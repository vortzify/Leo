A high-performance, developer-friendly React component library built with `TypeScript`, `Vite`, `Node.js`, and `Tailwind CSS`, designed for modern frontend workflows. Every component is fully typed, tree-shakeable, and optimized for fast builds with `pnpm`, `Bun`, and other contemporary bundlers.

The library comes with a robust testing setup using `Vitest` and `React Testing Library`, ensuring components are reliable, maintainable, and production-ready. `Tailwind CSS` integration allows for rapid, consistent styling while keeping components flexible and customizable. 

Perfect for developers who want a scalable, fast, and flexible UI foundation for modern React projects, with developer experience and productivity in mind.
